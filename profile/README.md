# Tech for Palestine Open Source

**Tech for Palestine (T4P)** is a nonprofit advancing Palestinian liberation through technology. We unite thousands of engineers, founders, product marketers, and technologists around the world to build open-source tools and advocacy platforms that support organizing, education, and awareness.

Since launching, we‚Äôve incubated 60+ projects spanning web, mobile, AI, and data, everything from media-bias trackers to boycott infrastructure. With active contributors and donors, T4P helps launch and scale tools that challenge censorship, amplify advocacy, and build alternatives.

## What We Build

T4P incubates and supports projects that meet real needs in Palestinian advocacy. Focus areas include:

- Media accountability and bias-tracking tools
- Boycott-enabling infrastructure and ethical tech alternatives
- Education, training, and hiring pipelines for Palestinian technologists
- Platforms for secure communication, protest coordination, and overcoming censorship barriers
- Other projects that are aligned with the mission and are in the technology field

Whether you're a developer, designer, researcher, or just open-source curious, we welcome contributors of all skill levels. Your PRs, issue reports, and feedback help move these projects forward.

Some of these projects are backed by the T4P incubator that provides mentorship, technical guidance, and visibility to support and grow their impact.
